	 gamemodes\test.amx 
While attempting to load a PAWN script, a file-not-found error was
encountered.  This could be caused by many things:

 * The wrong filename was given.
 * The wrong gamemodes path was given.
 * The server was launched from a different directory, making relative paths
   relative to the wrong place (and thus wrong).
 * You didn't copy the file to the correct directory or server.
 * The compilation failed, leading to no output file.
 * `-l` or `-a` were used to compile, which output intermediate steps for
   inspecting, rather than a full script.
 * Anything else, really just check the file is at the path given.
